# VectorGE

Rewrite of old 2d vector based game I wrote in highschool.

Instead of olc::PixelGameEngine, I'll be using raylib, and instead of C++, I'll be using C

NOTE:
currently the implementation of node.c is extremely suspicious. I will need to fix it **immediately**

TODO:
- optimize node.c
- optimize game.c
